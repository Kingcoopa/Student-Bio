      <p>
        I am Wilkinson J. Williams. I was born and raised in North Carolina. I went to college in Nashville, Tennessee. After college, I joined the military.
        I have served, in the armed forces, for a total of 14 years. I am also a Fireman for the City of Charlotte. I love both of my careers. I took on coding;
        with the purpose, of challenging my mind and maximizing my income. Believe, I am not in it for the money. I am in it for self-growth.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my spare time, I love to cook; draw/paint; take photographs/videos; travel (internationally); work on/sale cars; skateboard; and hang-out with my friends. I try to
        lead a reasonably active and responsible life. To be honest, I can not sit still. I am sure UNCC Coding Bootcamp will gratuate a flock of successful Coders. I feel fortunate
        to be on the roster.
